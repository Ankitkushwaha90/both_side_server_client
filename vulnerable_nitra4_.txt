Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability: The code concatenates user input directly into HTML strings without any sanitization. For instance, response.text is directly inserted into HTML elements. If response.text contains malicious JavaScript code, it could be executed in the context of other users' browsers, leading to XSS attacks.
No Input Validation: The code does not validate or sanitize user input before processing it. This lack of validation opens the door to various attacks such as SQL injection or arbitrary code execution if the input is manipulated by an attacker.
Insecure Communication: The code communicates with the server using plain HTTP. This can expose sensitive information to interception or manipulation by attackers. Using HTTPS would encrypt the communication between the client and server, providing confidentiality and integrity.
Missing CSRF Protection: There is no apparent protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Without CSRF tokens or other mitigation techniques, attackers could trick authenticated users into submitting unintended requests to the server.
